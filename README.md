# Bubble-os
Custom made arch based linux distro 
when will it release?  no date yet.
currently figuring out how to make this distro stand out and not just reskin arch linux
goals for the intial distro dinit init system built in rootkit/virus scanner  AUR guard and smth i call idiotsavior program.
idiotsavior tends to add 2fa better security and more for using rm commands  made for ppl who may have friends or other ppl who may wanna try to destroy your system.
currently doing it alone so it will take time 
ofc there will come more stuff but its in pre pre development.
